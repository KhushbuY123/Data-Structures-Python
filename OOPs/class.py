# OOPs : object oriented projgramming is used when we need to wkr with real word entities . OOPs uses the concept of classes and objects 
# Class: Class is the blue print of object. 
# Object : object are the real word entitites.
# for ex: let's take a scnerio we need to create a database which stores the students records here, we can consider students as a class and thier entites like : name , marks , subject and an object .Let's dry run the code below:

class Student():
    name="Khushbu"
    marks=90
s1=Student()
print(s1.name,s1.marks)

# Now here Student is the class name and s1 is the object we define and name and marks are the vlaues of the objects
